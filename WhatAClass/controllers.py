    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The usual web-app architecture is the MVC
    (Model-View-Controller). This class implements
    the controllers of the architecture.

    The structure used was Blueprints for the app to
    be scalable (create a divisional or functional
    structure and distribute the work among the contributors).
