Web page that acts as a graphic user interface for another application.

It will have user control and a few more features which will be detailed later.

Installation: Install python 3.x (latest), download, (optional) create virtual environment, cd to WhatAClass root, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies and execute `python3 start.py` or `python start.py` depending on your system.
