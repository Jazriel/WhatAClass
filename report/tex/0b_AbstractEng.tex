The main objective of this project is to create a web application, which must have a basic user control and capacity to classify images using a neural net. It must be able to re-train the neural net used to classify images.

Another requirement is for it to be done in a scalable manner and to be able to deploy it. The approach used should reduce the technical debt.

Scalability is a clear but abstract concept \cite{hill90}, Bondi \cite{bondi00} defines it as the capacity of a system to be able to be extended to manage a larger amount of workload. 

From a manteinance perspective a scalable system is that which can be modified to correct, extend or change attributes with ease.

Scalability is a complex property in software, there are many ways to scale a system. To increase the number of copies of software being executed,locally of in a distributed system. Decomposing the main system in many subsystems makes them easier to mantain and scale to the needs. The last option is to divide the services in diferent partitions, so that each partition provides service to a subset of the userbase.

This three scaling options are denominated in the book \emph{The Art of Scaling} \cite{scala09} as `\emph{the cube of scalability}'. 

The objective is to get a system scalable in the first two axis. Using virtualization with containers we can obtain the first axis. The second we will obtain with the microservice architecture. 

All this knowledge is used to create a system to provide image classification, this is due to the recent interest in machine learning and the aproach `AI first'. This is achieved with \eng{Tensorflow} \cite{tf}. The neural net to be used is Inception v3 \cite{incep} and the dataset Imagenet \cite{imnet}.

The system's scalability is wanted to be of performance and mantainability. This system's architedture should be easily scalable in both ways, and so the code shouldn't be complex to allow for future maintenance.
